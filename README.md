# ffxiv-s Overlay skin
###### Skin for ACT Overlay plugin

I originally just used the default codes that came with the overlay files of Rainbowmage and just fix and changed a few things to make it quite easier to control and know where everything are. This skin allows you to use the _parse.html_ for parsing dps and _timer.html_ for your spelltimers.

Here's what the overlay I recoded to be: <br />

You can also open up the _readme.html_ once you have it download for more information.

**NOTE:** I have not tested the timer.html with any sort of special spelltimer plugin for ACT. And I couldn't get a preview of the _timer.html_ for you guys to see, because I only did test with really short duration of certain actions/abilities. But I will say it doesn't look too bad.
